### HOW TO USE:
Create a file called `raw_directory` (note: no file extension) and copy-paste data directly from the website. It doesn't matter if the photo is selected. Run the python code like:

> $ python extract-directory.py

Hopefully in the same directory, a `refined_directory.csv` file exists as intended.
